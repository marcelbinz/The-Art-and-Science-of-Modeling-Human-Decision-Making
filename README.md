# The-Art-and-Science-of-Modeling-Human-Decision-Making

**Abstract**: Computational models are immensely useful for improving our understanding of the human mind, but working with such models can also be daunting. The goal of this tutorial is to familiarize you with a general set of tools that allow you to harvest the power of computational modeling in your own research projects. In the first part, I will demonstrate how to turn verbal theories into computational models on an example decision-making problem. The second part then covers how these models can be used to draw inferences about human decision-making processes. Part of the session will be interactive, so be sure to have a working version of Python together with the NumPy library installed.
